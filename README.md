# Weekly Planner

Weekly Planner has been created to be a week-based planner app that gives you one simple view of your week to plan out each day. You can set the week view to be either a 5 day week or a 7 day week depending on your needs.

Although the main page is the planner, there is more to it than just that. You can set goals under the **Goals** page, and once you complete them, you can view all that you've completed in the **Accomplishments** page. Also included is a handy **Notes** view for making quick notes about your week or goals.

You can view the live demo of it here: [Weekly Planner](http://cmspencer109.github.io.com)
